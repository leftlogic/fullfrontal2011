    <h1>Sponsorship Opportunities<span class="pdfDownload"> (<a href="sponsorship.pdf">pdf version</a>)</span></h1>
    <p><a href="http://2010.full-frontal.org/" title="Full Frontal - JavaScript Conference - 11th November 2011">Full Frontal</a> is this years only UK JavaScript conference, for front end developers and engineers who want to learn more about the capabilities of the language.</p>
    <p>The direct dictionary definition is: <em>with nothing concealed or held back</em>, which is the essence of the conference: to fully understand the World's most popular programming language<sup><a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/popular.html">&dagger;</a></sup>.</p>
  
    <p>Two hundred and eighty web developers from all over Europe will be able to attend on November 11th, 2011. Tickets have been priced to be affordable and cost &pound;100 for the early bird ticket, otherwise &pound;129.</p>

    <h2>Success of previous years</h2>
    <p>Below are just some of the positive things said about Full Frontal over the last 2 years, and we've captured a longer list on our <a href="http://twitter.com/fullfrontalconf/favorites">Twitter favourites</a>:
    <ul id="tweets">
      <li><a href="http://twitter.com/stompfrog/status/5916656950">stompfrog: Looking back at #fullfrontal09 program and thinking it was the best (and most comfortable) conference I have been to.</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://twitter.com/diegolago/status/5916211501">diegolago: #fullfrontal09 was an amazing conference with speakers who knew how to present truly inspiring topics. Notes will follow.</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://twitter.com/gazcarr/status/5915108978">gazcarr: @fullfrontalconf was awesome, learnt some really usefull stuff and can't wait to get stuck in! speakers were brilliant!</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://twitter.com/psd/status/5901415622">psd: headed back from #fullfrontal09 especially enjoyed the last three deep diving fun tech talks Kudos to @rem for putting on a great conference</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When &amp; Where</h2>
    <p>The one full day conference is being held on Friday 11th November at the Duke of Yorks Theatre, Brighton, UK.</p>
    <p>The prestigious <a href="http://www.picturehouses.co.uk/cinema_history.aspx?venueId=doyb" title="Picturehouse Cinemas">Duke of Yorks</a> was one of the World's first cinemas, first opening on 22nd September 1910.</p>    

    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>The conference is catering for the front end engineers in the web development community.</p>
    <p>Web professionals from the UK and across Europe are expected to attend.</p>
    <p>You will meet developers with a range of experience, including designers and backend developers looking to get a better understanding of the browser platform.</p>

    <h2>Speakers</h2>
    <p>Industry leaders of thought: <a href="http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/" title="Infrequently Noted">Alex Russell</a>, <a href="http://sebleedelisle.com/" title="Seb Lee-Delisle">Seb Lee-Delisle</a>, and <a href="http://2010.full-frontal.org/speakers">others</a>.</p><p>These speakers are hand picked by ourselves to ensure that the speaker is just as passionate about their topic as the delegate is about web development.</p>        

    <h2>The Organisers</h2>
    <p>The conference is being run by <a href="http://remysharp.com" title="remy sharp's b:log">Remy Sharp</a>: who runs <a href="http://leftlogic.com" title="Left Logic - Brighton web development and design consultancy">Left Logic</a>, a web development consultancy, and Julie Sharp: an events manager and running the logistics of the event.</p>
    
      <p>Remy is a developer, speaker and author for the most part on the topic of JavaScript.  Out of frustration that there was no conference that catered for the JavaScript community (anymore*), he and his wife decided to bring the conference to the UK.</p>
    
      <p><small>* @media Ajax was the first, and only other JavaScript conference, but it closed in 2008.</small></p>
